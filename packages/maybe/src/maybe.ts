/**
  Map over a {@linkcode Maybe} instance: apply the function to the wrapped value
  if the instance is {@linkcode Just}, and return {@linkcode Nothing} if the
  instance is `Nothing`.

  `map` works a lot like `Array.prototype.map`: `Maybe` and `Array` are both
  *containers* for other things. If you have no items in an array of numbers
  named `foo` and call `foo.map(x => x + 1)`, you'll still just have an array
  with nothing in it. But if you have any items in the array (`[2, 3]`), and you
  call `foo.map(x => x + 1)` on it, you'll get a new array with each of those
  items inside the array "container" transformed (`[3, 4]`).

  That's exactly what's happening with `map`. If the container is *empty* âÂ the
  `Nothing` variant â you just get back an empty container. If the container has
  something in it âÂ the `Just` variant âÂ you get back a container with the item
  inside transformed.

  (So... why not just use an array? The biggest reason is that an array can be
  any length. With a `Maybe`, we're capturing the idea of "something or nothing"
  rather than "0 to n" items. And this lets us implement a whole set of *other*
  interfaces, like those in this module.)

  Apply a function to the wrapped value if {@linkcode Just} and return a new
  `Just` containing the resulting value; or return {@linkcode Nothing} if

  This differs from {@linkcode map} in that `thenFn` returns another `Maybe`.
  You can use `andThen` to combine two functions which *both* create a `Maybe`
  from an unwrapped type.

  You may find the `.then` method on an ES6 `Promise` helpful for comparison: if
  you have a `Promise`, you can pass its `then` method a callback which returns
  another `Promise`, and the result will not be a *nested* promise, but a single
  `Promise`. The difference is that `Promise#then` unwraps *all* layers to only
  ever return a single `Promise` value, whereas `Maybe.andThen` will not unwrap
  nested `Maybe`s.

  This is sometimes also known as `bind`, but *not* aliased as such because
  [`bind` already means something in JavaScript][bind].

  [bind]:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind

  const aMaybeString = Maybe.of('Hello, there!');

  // Maybe<number>
  const resultingLength = andThen(toMaybeLength, aMaybeString);
  console.log(toString(resultingLength)); // 13
  ```

  Note that the result is not `Just(Just(13))`, but `Just(13)`!

  @typeparam T  The type of the wrapped value.
  @typeparam U  The type of the wrapped value in the resulting `Maybe`.
  @param thenFn The function to apply to the wrapped `T` if `maybe` is `Just`.
  @param maybe  The `Maybe` to evaluate and possibly apply a function to the
                contents of.
  @returns      The result of the `thenFn` (a new `Maybe`) if `maybe` is a
                `Just`, otherwise `Nothing` if `maybe` is a `Nothing`.

  JavaScript currently lacks.

  Instead of code like this:

  import Maybe from 'true-myth/maybe';

  const logValue = (mightBeANumber: Maybe<number>) => {
    const valueToLog = Maybe.mightBeANumber.isJust
      ? Maybe.unsafelyUnwrap(mightBeANumber).toString()

    console.log(valueToLog);
  };
  ```

  ...we can write code like this:

  ```ts
  import { match } from 'true-myth/maybe';

  const logValue = (mightBeANumber: Maybe<number>) => {
    const value = match(
      {

      },
      mightBeANumber
    );

    console.log(value);
  };
  ```

  This is slightly longer to write, but clearer: the more complex the resulting
  expression, the hairer it is to understand the ternary. Thus, this is
  especially convenient for times when there is a complex result, e.g. when
  rendering part of a React component inline in JSX/TSX.

/**
  Allows you to *apply* (thus `ap`) a value to a function without having to take
  either out of the context of their {@linkcode Maybe}s. This does mean that the
  transforming function is itself within a `Maybe`, which can be hard to grok at
  first but lets you do some very elegant things. For example, `ap` allows you
  to this:

  ```ts
  import { just, nothing } from 'true-myth/maybe';

  const one = just(1);
  const five = just(5);
  const none = nothing();

  const add = (a: number) => (b: number) => a + b;
  const maybeAdd = just(add);

  maybeAdd.ap(one).ap(five); // Just(6)
  maybeAdd.ap(one).ap(none); // Nothing
  maybeAdd.ap(none).ap(five) // Nothing
  ```

  Without `ap`, you'd need to do something like a nested `match`:

  ```ts
  import { just, nothing } from 'true-myth/maybe';

  const one = just(1);
  const five = just(5);
  const none = nothing();

  one.match({
    Just: n => five.match({
      Just: o => just(n + o),
      Nothing: () => nothing(),
    }),
    Nothing: ()  => nothing(),
  }); // Just(6)

  one.match({
    Just: n => none.match({
      Just: o => just(n + o),
      Nothing: () => nothing(),
    }),
    Nothing: ()  => nothing(),
  }); // Nothing

  none.match({
    Just: n => five.match({
      Just: o => just(n + o),
      Nothing: () => nothing(),
    }),
    Nothing: ()  => nothing(),
  }); // Nothing
  ```

  And this kind of thing comes up quite often once you're using `Maybe` to
  handle optionality throughout your application.

  For another example, imagine you need to compare the equality of two
  ImmutableJS data structures, where a `===` comparison won't work. With `ap`,
  that's as simple as this:

  ```ts
  import Maybe from 'true-myth/maybe';
  import { is as immutableIs, Set } from 'immutable';

  const is = (first: unknown) =>  (second: unknown) => 
    immutableIs(first, second);

  const x = Maybe.of(Set.of(1, 2, 3));
  const y = Maybe.of(Set.of(2, 3, 4));

  Maybe.of(is).ap(x).ap(y); // Just(false)
  ```

  Without `ap`, we're back to that gnarly nested `match`:

  ```ts
  import Maybe, { just, nothing } from 'true-myth/maybe';
  import { is, Set } from 'immutable';

  const x = Maybe.of(Set.of(1, 2, 3));
  const y = Maybe.of(Set.of(2, 3, 4));

  x.match({
    Just: iX => y.match({
      Just: iY => Maybe.just(is(iX, iY)),
      Nothing: () => Maybe.nothing(),
    })
    Nothing: () => Maybe.nothing(),
  }); // Just(false)
  ```

  In summary: anywhere you have two `Maybe` instances and need to perform an
  operation that uses both of them, `ap` is your friend.

  Two things to note, both regarding *currying*:

  1.  All functions passed to `ap` must be curried. That is, they must be of the
      form (for add) `(a: number) => (b: number) => a + b`, *not* the more usual
      `(a: number, b: number) => a + b` you see in JavaScript more generally.

      (Unfortunately, these do not currently work with lodash or Ramda's `curry`
      helper functions. A future update to the type definitions may make that
      work, but the intermediate types produced by those helpers and the more
      general function types expected by this function do not currently align.)

  2.  You will need to call `ap` as many times as there are arguments to the
      function you're dealing with. So in the case of this `add3` function,
      which has the "arity" (function argument count) of 3 (`a` and `b`), you'll
      need to call `ap` twice: once for `a`, and once for `b`. To see why, let's
      look at what the result in each phase is:

      ```ts
      const add3 = (a: number) => (b: number) => (c: number) => a + b + c;

      const maybeAdd = just(add); // Just((a: number) => (b: number) => (c: number) => a + b + c)
      const maybeAdd1 = maybeAdd.ap(just(1)); // Just((b: number) => (c: number) => 1 + b + c)
      const maybeAdd1And2 = maybeAdd1.ap(just(2)) // Just((c: number) => 1 + 2 + c)
      const final = maybeAdd1.ap(just(3)); // Just(4)
      ```

      So for `toString`, which just takes a single argument, you would only need
      to call `ap` once.

      ```ts
      const toStr = (v: { toString(): string }) => v.toString();
      just(toStr).ap(12); // Just("12")
      ```

  One other scenario which doesn't come up *quite* as often but is conceivable
  is where you have something that may or may not actually construct a function
  for handling a specific `Maybe` scenario. In that case, you can wrap the
  possibly-present in `ap` and then wrap the values to apply to the function to
  in `Maybe` themselves.

  __Aside:__ `ap` is not named `apply` because of the overlap with JavaScript's
  existing [`apply`] function â and although strictly speaking, there isn't any
  direct overlap (`Maybe.apply` and `Function.prototype.apply` don't intersect
  at all) it's useful to have a different name to avoid implying that they're
  the same.

/**

  ```ts
  const foo = document.querySelector('#foo');
  let width: number;
  if (foo !== null) {
    width = foo.getBoundingClientRect().width;
  } else {
    width = 0;

    } else {

  (Imagine in this example that there were more than two options: the
  simplifying workarounds you commonly use to make this terser in JS, like the
  ternary operator or the short-circuiting `||` or `??` operators, eventually
  become very confusing with more complicated flows.)

  We can work around this with `Maybe`, always wrapping each layer in
  {@linkcode Maybe.of} invocations, and this is *somewhat* better:

  ```ts
  import Maybe from 'true-myth/maybe';

  const aWidth = Maybe.of(document.querySelector('#foo'))
    .map(el => el.getBoundingClientRect().width)
    .unwrapOr(0);

  const aColor = Maybe.of(document.querySelector('.bar'))
    .andThen(el => Maybe.of(getStyle(el, 'color'))
    .unwrapOr('black');
  ```

  With `wrapReturn`, though, you can create a transformed version of a function
  *once* and then be able to use it freely throughout your codebase, *always*
